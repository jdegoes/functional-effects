/*
 * INTRODUCTION
 *
 * ZIO effects are immutable data values that model a possibly complex series
 * of async, concurrent, resourceful, and contextual computations.
 *
 * The only effect type in ZIO is called ZIO, and has three type parameters,
 * which permit accessing context from an environment (`R`), failing with a
 * value of a certain type (`E`), and succeeding with a value of a certain
 * type (`A`).
 *
 * Unlike Scala's Future, ZIO effects are completely lazy. All methods on ZIO
 * effects return new ZIO effects. No part of the workflow is executed until
 * one of the `unsafeRun*` functions are called.
 *
 * ZIO effects are transformed and combined using methods on the ZIO data type.
 * For example, two effects can be combined into a sequential workflow using
 * an operator called `zip`. Similarly, two effects can be combined into a
 * parallel workflow using an operator called `zipPar`.
 *
 * The operators on the ZIO data type allow very powerful, expressive, and
 * type-safe transformation and composition, while the methods in the ZIO
 * companion object allow building new effects from simple values (which are
 * not themselves effects).
 *
 * In this section, you will explore both the ZIO data model itself, as well
 * as the very basic operators used to transform and combine ZIO effects, as
 * well as a few simple ways to build effects.
